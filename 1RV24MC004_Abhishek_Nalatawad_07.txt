Deploy a Web Application to Kubernetes using Minikube.


STEP 1 - Start Minikube
minikube start


STEP 2 - Check Minikube Status
minikube status


You should see:
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured


STEP 3 - If Minikube is not running, restart it
minikube delete
minikube start --driver=docker




STEP 4 - Create the Deployment file (nginx-deployment.yaml)
Create a new file:
nginx-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80




STEP 5 - Apply the deployment
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml




STEP 6 - Check Deployment & Pods
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods


You should see 2 pods running.
STEP 7 -Expose the Deployment as a Service
kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment \
  --type=NodePort \
  --port=80


This creates a service that exposes Nginx to your system.
STEP 8 - Check Services
kubectl get services


A service named nginx-deployment should appear with a NodePort.
STEP 9 - Access the Webpage
Minikube provides a shortcut to open the app:
minikube service nginx-deployment


This will open the browser showing the Nginx Welcome Page.


STEP 10 — Clean Up (Optional)
Delete all pods
kubectl delete pods --all
Delete all services
kubectl delete svc --all
Delete all deployments
kubectl delete deployments --all
